# CAPTCHA Solver Demo\n\nThis is a simple, single-file, responsive HTML application demonstrating a CAPTCHA verification process. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and includes JavaScript to handle image loading and user input verification.\n\n## Features\n\n*   **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a good user experience across various device sizes.\n*   **Dynamic Image Loading**: The application can load CAPTCHA images from a URL specified in the query parameters (e.g., `?url=https://example.com/captcha.png`).\n*   **Default CAPTCHA Image**: If no URL is provided, it defaults to the `sample.png` image included in the project.\n*   **User Input Verification**: Users can enter the text they perceive from the CAPTCHA image, and the application will provide instant feedback.\n*   **Client-Side Logic**: All verification logic for the default `sample.png` is handled client-side.\n\n## How to Use\n\n1.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.\n2.  **Verify Default CAPTCHA**: Enter "ADUR3" into the input field and click "Verify CAPTCHA". The application is case-insensitive for verification.\n3.  **Load Custom CAPTCHA (Optional)**: To load an image from a specific URL, append `?url=` followed by the image URL to your browser's address bar.\n    *   Example: `file:///path/to/your/index.html?url=https://www.example.com/your-captcha-image.png`\n    *   **Note**: Due to browser security policies (CORS), loading images from different origins might be restricted unless the server explicitly allows it. For local testing, using an image from the same origin or a CORS-enabled server is recommended.\n4.  **Reset**: Click "Load Default CAPTCHA" to return to the bundled `sample.png` and clear any custom URL parameters.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n*   HTML5\n*   Tailwind CSS (via CDN)\n*   JavaScript\n\n## Project Structure\n\n*   `index.html`: The main application file containing HTML, CSS (Tailwind CDN), and JavaScript.\n*   `README.md`: This file.\n*   `LICENSE`: The MIT License for this project.\n*   `sample.png`: The default CAPTCHA image used when no custom URL is provided.\n\n## Contribution\n\nFeel free to fork this repository and make your own improvements or modifications.\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer**: This application is a simplified demonstration of a CAPTCHA verification interface and does not implement advanced image recognition for solving arbitrary CAPTCHAs.
